Description: Species sensitivity distributions are cumulative probability
    distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for
    different species as described by Posthuma et al.(2001)
    <isbn:9781566705783>.  The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to
    fit distributions such as the gamma, log-logistic, log-normal and
    Weibull to censored and/or weighted data.  Multiple distributions can
    be averaged using Akaike Information Criteria.  Confidence intervals
    on hazard concentrations and proportions are produced by parametric
    bootstrapping.
